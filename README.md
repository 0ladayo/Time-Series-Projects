# Time-Series-Projects

This repository contains two time series analysis projects:

1. East Midlands House Prices Data Project: In this project, I analyzed the house price data for the East Midlands region. I fitted an appropriate SARIMA model to the data and used it to forecast the average house prices for the next six months.

2. Midlands Temperature Data Project: In this project, I analyzed temperature data for the Midlands region. I fitted an appropriate ARIMA model to the data for analysis.

The Report file includes a detailed report of the analysis conducted on both projects.
